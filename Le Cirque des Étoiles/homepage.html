			<h1>Welcome one and all, to Le Cirque des Étoiles!</h1>

			<h3>
				You play as Susan, a bright, curious girl who is more timid than she would like to admit. She lives in a small village in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside, where nothing interesting ever happens. Until the circus arrives. She and her best friend Jessica go with their friends to this circus that appears out of nowhere.
			</h3>

				Will you help Susan figure out the mysteries behind the circus, or will she go home and experience richer but no wiser on this cold winter's night?
