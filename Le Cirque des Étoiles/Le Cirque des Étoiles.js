The circus is so lit up it was as if they were walking in daytime. The clearing seems much bigger than she remembers, the central square looks absolutely huge. There are four tents she can see, two smaller ones on the left, one smaller one on the right, and the big top across the square from them in the middle, which seems impossibly enormous, much bigger even than it had looked at a distance, towering over the trees. There are differently coloured paths of light leading to the different tents. The light shines up right through the snow, without melting it.","\n","^There is a green path leading towards the leftmost tent. The tent itself is decorated in stripes of green and red. The tent says “Children” on the front.","\n","^The tent next to it has no sign, but has a light blue path towards a tent striped in light blue and silver, almost seeming to shimmer like a mirror.","\n","^The rightmost tent has a dark purple path, the tent draped in a blue so dark it's almost black like the night, sparkling with stars.","\n","^The big top has a big golden path toward it, twice as wide as the others. The golden  tent itself shines like the sun. There are staff members in front of the entrance, preventing people from getting in. It seems to be closed for the moment.","\n","^The square in front of them is littered with sculptures and performers, each dressed in fantastical outfits. There are fire-eaters, each one with a differently coloured fire. There are jugglers, alone or in groups, performing impossibly dextrous throws. There are magicians, performing tricks they had never seen before, and many more things to look at. There are staff members everywhere, all dressed the same as the one in the ticket booth, but nobody pays much attention to them. They are as unobtrusive as they possibly can be.","\n","^In between the big top and the rightmost tent there are a number of concession stands, with mouth-watering smells emanating towards the group. A great many benches and tables have been set up, all decorated in multi-coloured strings of twinkly lights. Susan doesn't know where to look, trying to take everything in at once as her friends discuss where to go.","\n","^JESSICA: “I want to go to the silver and blue one! And then the black sparkly one!”","\n","^NED: “Of course you do.

Unbelievable! Susan, let's get going.” Jessica resolutely strode off into the crowd.","\n","^Susan looks between Jessica and James as they both head off. While she is standing there thinking, a woman with a stroller stops in front of Susan, and by the time she gets around the lady she has completely lost sight of Jessica. She calls out, looking around for her friend, but she is nowhere to be seen. Susan looks around a while, calling out, but gets no response.

They climb the ladders to the trapeze and the highwire.  Only two get onto the highwire, the others start swinging from the trapezes. There is no net. As they show build momentum, each feat of balance and each jump on the trapezes getting more daring and drawing more gasps from the audience, there are a couple of flying dancers that drop from the celing unexpectedly, dangling from large red ribbons. Susan notices that neither the highwires or ribbons seem to be attached to anything, and when she squints she can again see an aura around some of the dancers, a green one this time. At the end of their act they suddenly all drop down to the ring and the lights cut out, causing some alarmed yells from the audience. Half a beat later the light is on again and they are posed in a human pyramid, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.
