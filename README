Technical Specifications:
- What data will you need to store? How will it be organized? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationships with other tables.
  - I will need to store the app somewhere, if I want to publish it: on the hosting site.
  - I will need a users table with the columns: Username, Email, Password.
  - I might be able to store the story results in the database so users can see the endings they have reached.
    But I'm not sure if that is possible using Ink. If so, I will need a table with the stories, title, description (how their game went)

- What does your product look like? List each view, their purpose, and how they work
  - It will be an interactive app like Sorcery! 1, 2 or 3. It will have a homepage with an intro to the game and login, and then a link
  to the page where they will be able to read the story once they are logged in.

- Describe any complex business logic that is happening in your application. For example, how does data flow through your application
  - Well my application will not be a web app exactly, though I will have a website for users to login. It will be a game with
    branching options and different endings, making a choose-your-own-adventure style game.

Have a timeline of milestones to reach, including deadlines:
- Create milestones that represent the discrete blocks of functionality:
- Give an estimate for how long each will take per engineer:
- Come up with a timeline of goals to stick to:
  - Decide on what story I want to tell, and write out different endings and paths for it, including the 'ideal' happy ending (sun 27 aug) (24 hours)
  - Figure out how to use Ink and Inky (or possibly Inklewriter, which is simpler, if I can't figure it out) (fri 25 aug) (48 hours)
  - Build the website that will contain the game (or game download link) and lets users login and hypes up the game (wed 30 aug) (24 hours)
  - Take into account that everything might take longer than the time I have estimated, so making sure to keep some time available for unforeseen delays.
